# ðŸ–¥ Lab 9: Building a Kotlin Multiplatform Application

## Objectives
1. Use Ktor to make a network request to an external api
2. Use expect/actual to define platform-specific request headers
3. Use kotlinx.serialization to deserialize the response
4. Create a presenter class in common code that makes the network request and exposes a view state class
5. Consume this presenter from both Android and iOS apps to display the results of the network request
