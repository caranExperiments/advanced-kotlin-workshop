<h2>Writing Helper Functions 2</h2>

<p>In this example, we've defined another helper function <em>isNotNullOrBlank()</em> by negating the value return from
    standard library function <em>isNullOrBlank()</em>.</p>

<p>While <em>isNullOrBlank()</em> may helper the compiler infer nullability (thanks to Contracts), the compiler cannot
    extend those inferences to a function calling into another function that includes a contract.</p>

<p>This highlights the need for helper functions to define their own contracts - rather than relying on the contracts of
    functions they may use in their implementation.</p>

<h3>Improving Compiler Inferences</h3>
<p>In the next examples, we'll improve these helper functions by making use of Kotlin's Contract apis.</p>
<p>By defining a contract, we'll be able to avoid the additional null-safe calls when accessing our <em>name</em>
    variable after calling our helper functions.</p>
