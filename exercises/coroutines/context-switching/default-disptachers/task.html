<h2>CoroutineContext and Dispatchers</h2>
<p>Coroutines are executed within a <em>CoroutineContext</em> which is comprised of two key components</p>
<ol>
    <li>Job</li>
    <li>Dispatcher</li>
</ol>
<p>We've seen that a <em>Job</em> is a handle to a coroutine and allows us to cancel or wait on a coroutine.</p>
<p>The <em>Dispatcher</em> determines which thread will be used for execution of the coroutine.</p>
<p>By passing different dispatchers to our coroutine builders, we can control which threads are used to execute the coroutines.</p>
