<h2>Bridging Between Non-Coroutine Code Using runBlocking{}</h2>
<p>In our examples so far, we've had to explicitly block the calling thread to ensure our coroutines complete.</p>
<p>This isn't ideal though.  What can we do to improve this?</p>
<br>
<p>We can introduce the concept of a <em>Coroutine Builder</em> to address this.</p>
<p>We've already seen one coroutine builder - <em>launch{}</em></p>
<p>We'll now look at another builder - <em>runBlocking{}</em></p>
<br>
<p>The <em>runBlocking{}</em> function runs a new coroutine that blocks the current thread until the coroutine's completion.</p>

<br>
<h3>📝 Instructions</h3>
<p>Replace the implementation of <em>main()</em> to use <em>runBlocking{}</em></p> to avoid the explicit call to <em>Thread.sleep()</em>

<br>
<h3>🤔 Observations</h3>
<ul>
    <li> Notice that now, we don't need any explicit code to sleep/delay our main thread. </li>
</ul>
