<h2>Either</h2>

<p>The <em>Either</em> type helps us explicitly define a data type that represents both the possible <b>success</b> and <b>failure</b> types of an operation.</p>
<p>Say we make a request, that we know will return a calculated value, or some exception, we can use an <em>Either</em> to explicitly define both of these states.</p>
